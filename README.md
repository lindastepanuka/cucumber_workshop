# Cucumber Workshop

A workshop for Tieto Baltic Networking Conference. Based on [Shouty.js](https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/shouty.js).

## Shouty

Shouty is a social networking application for short physical distances.
When someone shouts, only people within 1000m distance can hear it.

Shouty doesn't exist yet - you will implement it yourself!

That is, if you're attending the BDD/Cucumber workshop.

## Agenda

### Get the code

Git:

    git clone https://github.com/lindastepanuka/cucumber_workshop.git
    cd cucumber_workshop

Or simply [download](https://github.com/lindastepanuka/cucumber_workshop/releases) a zip or tarball.

### Set up environment

* Install Node.js
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm test`

You should see:

    0 scenarios
    0 steps

### Brainstorm capabilities

* Who are the main stakeholders?
* What can people do with the app?
* What are the main differentiators from other apps?

### Pick one capability

* Define rules
* Create high level examples (Friends episodes)

Then do this for each example to discover more examples:

* Can you think of a context where the outcome would be different?
* Are there any other outcomes we haven't thought about?

### Implement one capability. Text UI only.

* Write a Cucumber Scenario for one of the examples
* Make it pass!
